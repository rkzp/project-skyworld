# Project: SkyWorld
a large open world game about flying, crafting, trading and fighting
*(game name is temporary and is subject to change)*

### current state: mess; not suitable for production.
- documentation: lacking
- unused resources: many
- design document: mythical

### double precision engine build is required!
check out [this article on godot docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/physics/large_world_coordinates.html) for more information on this whole thing.

### note on performance:
this game is being developed by sole developer on ye olde i3-2130, r9 270 and 24gb RAM, targetting 60-80 fps yet prioritizing quality on said machine. sacrifices for weaker machines, other than upscaling and reduced shadowmap resolution, will probably not made, as modern machines tend to be bit newer and more powerful than developer's one.

credits and stuff:
- made with godot engine 4.0.3
- a lot of textures are kindly provided by ambientcg.com
